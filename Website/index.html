    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="about-me-text">

      <p->I am Dylan blah blah wait laufey reference???? lets go? He Zhiwu: I was very talkative when I was small    
        But at age five, I ate a can of pineapple that had expired, and I stopped talking. For that reason, I have very few friends.
        He Zhiwu: I found it very hard to find work too. I finally decided to be my own boss. Having no capital, the only thing 
        I can do is sneak into other people's shops after hours and run my own business. I'm not a freeloader. 
        I just think it makes sense, since the rent's already been paid, to run the business around the clock.
        He Zhiwu: Who says nobody buys pork at 3:00 a.m.? I came yesterday to buy some, didn't I? 
        If you want to do business, you have to take each customer's needs into account.
        He Zhiwu: Buddha said, "If I don't descend into hell, who will?" When you're the boss, 
        you have to be kind, caring and tolerant. You can't just look to your own gain. I know very well there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I always work very hard until the wee hours.
        He Zhiwu: I don't make a lot of money, but I'm happy. </p->

        <h3>My approach to design</h3>        
        <br>
        <p->
            He Zhiwu: We rub shoulders with many people everyday. Some may become close friends, or confidants. That's why I'm always optimistic. 
            Sometimes it hurts. Not to worry - I try to stay happy. That night, I saw that woman again. I knew we'd never be friends or 
            confidants. 
            We'd let too many chances pass us by. Nothing happened, there was no chemistry. Maybe it was the weather, but that night I 
            found her very alluring.
            [first lines]
            The Killer's Agent: Are we still partners?
            Wong Chi-Ming: [voiceover] We've been business partners for nearly three years. This is the first time we've ever sat together. 
            We hardly 
            ever see each other. I know how hard it is for a man to control his passion. Partners shouldn't get emotionally involved with 
            each other

                Kawaii, I know, so sassy
                I'm feeling awfully heady
                I might just overload I might break free

                Why can't you stop?
                Don't know why, but deep inside, this may be
