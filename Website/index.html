      <p->I am Dylan blah blah wait laufey reference???? lets go? He Zhiwu: I was very talkative when I was small    
        But at age five, I ate a can of pineapple that had expired, and I stopped talking. For that reason, I have very few friends.
        He Zhiwu: I found it very hard to find work too. I finally decided to be my own boss. Having no capital, the only thing 
        I can do is sneak into other people's shops after hours and run my own business. I'm not a freeloader. 
        I just think it makes sense, since the rent's already been paid, to run the business around the clock.
        He Zhiwu: Who says nobody buys pork at 3:00 a.m.? I came yesterday to buy some, didn't I? 
        If you want to do business, you have to take each customer's needs into account.
        He Zhiwu: Buddha said, "If I don't descend into hell, who will?" When you're the boss, 
        you have to be kind, caring and tolerant. You can't just look to your own gain. I know very well there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I always work very hard until the wee hours.
        He Zhiwu: I don't make a lot of money, but I'm happy. </p->

        <p->
            He Zhiwu: We rub shoulders with many people everyday. Some may become close friends, or confidants. That's why I'm always optimistic. 
            Sometimes it hurts. Not to worry - I try to stay happy. That night, I saw that woman again. I knew we'd never be friends or 
            confidants. 
            We'd let too many chances pass us by. Nothing happened, there was no chemistry. Maybe it was the weather, but that night I 
            found her very alluring.
            [first lines]
            The Killer's Agent: Are we still partners?
            Wong Chi-Ming: [voiceover] We've been business partners for nearly three years. This is the first time we've ever sat together. 
            We hardly 
            ever see each other. I know how hard it is for a man to control his passion. Partners shouldn't get emotionally involved with 
            each other

            <p->"Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure, Souls-like game set on a forgotten planet, collapsed and filled with junk.
              <br>
              <br>
              Players take on the harsh world as a robot called "SCR4-P1" (also known as "Scrappy") who has crash landed on the desolate planet. Scrappy and by extension the player must explore and learn about the planet's past to find parts and repair their ship. Although this won't be easy, other robots whether being relics of the past or those who have also ended up trapped here scour the planet in search of fresh parts they can use to upgrade their now rusty exteriors.
              <br>
              <br>
              Luckily, Scrappy is capable of crafting weapons, upgrades and supplies that the player can use in combat or to enhance their abilities. In a world where everything is against you and the odds of surviving are almost zero.
              <br>
              <br>
  
              
              Can you get Scrappy home?

              <br>
              
              Scrap Forge was a collaborative project between the design, art and development cohorts at BCU serving as our final major project for our first year. On this project I was given the role of lead overall designer, lead level designer, and lead camera designer managing a team of 22 designers and the overall direction of the 70+ member large team across 3 months of development.
