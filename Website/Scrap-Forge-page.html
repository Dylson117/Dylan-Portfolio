        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p-><p->"Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure, Souls-like game set on a forgotten planet, collapsed and filled with junk.
              <br>
              <br>
              Players take on the harsh world as a robot called "SCR4-P1" (also known as "Scrappy") who has crash landed on the desolate planet. Scrappy and by extension the player must explore and learn about the planet's past to find parts and repair their ship. Although this won't be easy, other robots whether being relics of the past or those who have also ended up trapped here scour the planet in search of fresh parts they can use to upgrade their now rusty exteriors.
              <br>
              <br>
              Luckily, Scrappy is capable of crafting weapons, upgrades and supplies that the player can use in combat or to enhance their abilities. In a world where everything is against you and the odds of surviving are almost zero.
              <br>
              <br>
  
              
              Can you get Scrappy home?
            </p->

        <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
        <p-> During my time on Scrap Forge I had many responsibilities with the most important being to manage and lead my team of 22 designers but also to communicate our ideas effectively to the art and development cohorts throughout the entire development process. Across this time I learnt how to manage team conflicts effectively, delegate work, how to think critically and efficiently about mechanics and their necessity to the project and most importantly I learnt how to improve my communication skills. 
        <br>
        <br>  
        
        
        Alongside managing my team, I also had to manage their game design documentation, coming up with my own structure that the team followed closely. Keeping the documentation as readable as possible for the other cohorts was a primary objective of mine and I believe we achieved that. A small section of the documentation can be seen by clicking on the link to the right.
        <br>
        <br>  
        Furthermore, as lead overall designer it was my job to give weekly presentations across the projects 3 month duration on the games progress to not only the three cohort lecturers but also to the entire team of 70+ members. I believe that this experience has aided my communication and presentation skills greatly with it being one of the first times I have ever had to do something like that. 
        <br>
        <br>  
        Another one of my responsibilities was in level design, it was my job to design two of the three levels found in Scrap Forge with these being the Junkyard and the Factory (level 1 and 2). This aided me greatly in deepening my understanding of level design both in theory and in engine. My design documentation for these two levels can be seen by clicking on the link to the right.
        <br>
        <br>  
        Alongside level design, it was also my duty to work alongside another designer and design the camera used in Scrap Forge from the ground up with this being one of the aspects I found most challenging about the project.
